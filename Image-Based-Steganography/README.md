Hide photos in photos without modifying source or reference data 

Random kernel selection with varying padding

Shuffle source directory photos 

Find square from source image in random dataset of images

Note iteration of shuffle 

Note pattern match coordinate in reference image 

Note source coordinate for recreation 

Note padding size above before 


Etc

Another solution say you have an image thats 50x50 pixels

that is 2500 pixels

now we need specific images for our dayaset

k means reduce the reference images to 1 color. this is where we store our paint 

for example lets say our first image oixel in the hidden photo we are trying to recreate is pink

the fkrst image in our reconstruction dataset would k means reduce to pink

the second pixel in in our hidden image is red

the second photo in our dataset k means reduces to red
______________________________________

could even hide colors of hidden image as border around high resolution images -> 3rd way

______________________________________

k means reduce an image to say 30 colors 

store these color values as  my style sheet for crrtain elements if fake websire

how can we store the map in the fake websire html as well?
