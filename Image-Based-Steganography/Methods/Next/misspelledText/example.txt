looking at the exMple images above the screenshot in procreate exports to 10x10 pixels bht ehen virwed it upscales the resolution tk fit the width of the iphone creating gradients 

^ possible now tk hide grayscale video and knahes and only save the original 10x10 imahes and to unlock fjrst step must be viewed and screen recorded on an iphone to get the legitimate map after the algorithm to upscale has occured 


recoloring possible through machine learning..

^ method of undisguising map is totally dependent kn the upscaling algorithm... fuck ip the map always use different upscaling algorkthm and noise to destroy grayscale map 



^other places upscaling kccurs 

procreate you can set a specific resolution and insert an image and choose rotation opacity different attributes you could use procreate as one kf the keys and upsampling sith specificly touched inputs to generate a map rathher than viewinf tbe low res data in skmething like photos 

spelling mistakes - done on ipjone 



fuck hse spelling mistakes and distance away from the correctly typed word alphabetically or bit wise to create map




Here!!

misspelled word -> get dictionary wird closest to -> subtract distance alphabetically or bitwise to create map of encoding
