so instead of making a column vector or padding an original image with the mutated image as a border
inject the image as a border in a frame in the image trying to match the color values to the cascading frame
except at edge points

best case scenario for hiding:
    only two edge pixels show up as a reference

    by having two oposing edge corners like top left and bottom right we get 
    the resolution and coordinates of frame for reconstruction
