apparently when things like photo shop create png they encode a color table and at bare minimum a gradient for something like grayscale but in any color not just black to white or white to black

internet says if you chsnge this color table to two of same colornyou get a png that is just a single color but it can be restored by reverting back to the original color table like 0-255

example i saw was photoshop changing color table of gradient from values of (0,0,0) to (0,0,0) or example (255,255,255) to (255,255,255) establishing the lac of gradient
